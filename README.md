# Python Learning Path

This directory contains several Python files to help you learn Python programming step by step.

## Files and Topics

### Basic Python
1. `01_basics.py` - Variables, data types, and basic operations
2. `02_control_flow.py` - If statements, loops, and control structures
3. `03_functions.py` - Function definitions and usage
4. `04_data_structures.py` - Lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples
5. `05_classes.py` - Object-oriented programming basics

### Data Science and Machine Learning
6. `06_numpy_basics.py` - NumPy array operations and numerical computing
7. `07_pandas_basics.py` - Data manipulation and analysis with Pandas
8. `08_matplotlib_basics.py` - Data visualization and plotting
9. `09_tensorflow_basics.py` - Deep learning with TensorFlow
10. `10_pytorch_basics.py` - Deep learning with PyTorch

## How to Run

Each file can be run independently using Python:
```bash
python filename.py
```

## Requirements
Install required packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Note
The machine learning examples (TensorFlow and PyTorch) are basic introductions. Real-world applications would require more data, proper model architecture, hyperparameter tuning, and validation procedures.
